# Data Science Project: Book Information Dataset

This project is a task assignment for Datacolab company. The objective is to create a Python script or notebook that combines NLP, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Data Visualization to analyze and understand a dataset of book summaries.

## 🎯 Objective

Create a Python script or notebook that combines NLP, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Data Visualization to analyze and understand a dataset of book summaries. This involves:
- Cleaning the data
- Exploring its characteristics through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Shortening the summaries
- Transforming them into images

## 🛠️ Requirements

### 1. Data Preprocessing and EDA
- Clean the data by handling missing values.
- Explore the dataset to understand its characteristics.

### 2. NLP Component
- Condense the book summaries to make them shorter.

### 3. Computer Vision Component
- Convert the condensed text summaries into images using a Text-to-Image model.

## 📊 Output

The script should provide:
- The condensed text summaries.
- The converted images.
- The findings from the exploratory data analysis.

## 🚀 Getting Started
