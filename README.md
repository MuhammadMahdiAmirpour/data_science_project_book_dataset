# Data Science Project: Book Information Dataset

This project is a task assignment for Datacolab company. The objective is to create a Python script or notebook that combines NLP, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Data Visualization to analyze and understand a dataset of book summaries.

## 🎯 Objective

The main objective of this project is to analyze and understand a dataset of book summaries using various data science techniques. The project involves:

- **Data Preprocessing and EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**: Cleaning the data and exploring its characteristics to uncover patterns and insights.
- **NLP (Natural Language Processing)**: Condensing the book summaries to make them shorter while preserving the main information.
- **Computer Vision**: Converting the condensed text summaries into images using a Text-to-Image model.

## 🛠️ Requirements

### 1. Data Preprocessing and EDA
- **Clean the data**: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and ensure the data is in a usable format.
- **Explore the dataset**: Understand the distribution of data, identify patterns, and generate summary statistics.

### 2. NLP Component
- **Condense the book summaries**: Use NLP techniques to shorten the summaries while keeping the essential information intact.

### 3. Computer Vision Component
- **Convert text to images**: Use a Text-to-Image model to transform the condensed summaries into visual representations.

## 📊 Output

The script should provide:
- **Condensed text summaries**: Shortened versions of the original book summaries.
- **Converted images**: Visual representations of the condensed summaries.
- **Findings from EDA**: Insights and patterns discovered during the exploratory data analysis.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.8 or higher**: Ensure Python is installed on your system.
- **Jupyter Notebook or any other Python IDE**: For running and editing the script/notebook.
